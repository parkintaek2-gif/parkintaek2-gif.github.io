rem SeoulMarkets - keep our own AIs learning during work hours (07:10-21:10, hourly).
rem Owner's instruction 2026-09-24: AI must keep learning in the background during work hours.
rem
rem WHY a Windows task and not a session cron:
rem   The invest-AI reader ran on session 6's cron. That seat disappeared and the cron
rem   vanished with it - the AI sat frozen from 2026-09-15 for 9 days and nobody knew.
rem   Session crons live only in session memory. This file does not.
rem
rem KEEP THIS FILE ASCII ONLY - comments AND arguments.
rem   A previous version passed a Korean argument (--<save in Korean>). cmd.exe read it as
rem   CP949, ate the following characters, and every line after it broke. The scheduled task
rem   still reported exit 0 while doing nothing at all. That is the worst kind of failure.
rem   Korean explanation: docs/jachae-ai-learning.md

rem 0) refresh the source tape FIRST - the reader can only see what the tape holds.
rem    2026-09-25: the valuation tape sat at the 20260914 price snapshot for 11 days.
rem    Nobody noticed, because the reader kept re-writing the same signals every day and
rem    that looked like work. Reading a frozen tape is not learning. Rebuild, then read.

rem 1) invest AI: read our market data, write "what kind of stock is this" signals

rem 2) KLifeMap AI: harvest real customer questions from each language's community
rem    Owner 2026-09-24: "look at the communities of each language, not just Korean sites"
rem    Questions ONLY - never the answers. See the file header for why.

rem 3) measure whether both AIs are actually learning
